# CesarChiffrementPy
 Very simple script in python with the cipher Cesar. This encryption follows this equation: number of the letter + key / 26, the rest of this division will give the number of the new letter. Example: the letter Y is associated with 24, we add 7 to it, we obtain 31. The remainder of the Euclidean division of 31 by 26 is 5. What gives E. Y is therefore coded by E. You can therefore choose the key of encryption.  - Requierment:  apt-get install pip3 pip3 install slugify
